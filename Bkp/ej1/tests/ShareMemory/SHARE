       sshhmmggeett() returns the identifier of the System V shared memory segment associated with the value of the argument _k_e_y.  A new shared memory segment, with size equal to the value of _s_i_z_e rounded up to a multiple of PPAAGGEE__SSIIZZEE, is cre‚Äê
       ated if _k_e_y has the value IIPPCC__PPRRIIVVAATTEE or _k_e_y isn't IIPPCC__PPRRIIVVAATTEE, no shared memory segment corresponding to _k_e_y exists, and IIPPCC__CCRREEAATT is specified in _s_h_m_f_l_g.

       If _s_h_m_f_l_g specifies both IIPPCC__CCRREEAATT and IIPPCC__EEXXCCLL and a shared memory segment already exists for _k_e_y, then sshhmmggeett() fails with _e_r_r_n_o set to EEEEXXIISSTT.  (This is analogous to the effect of the combination OO__CCRREEAATT || OO__EEXXCCLL for ooppeenn(2).)

       The value _s_h_m_f_l_g is composed of:

       IIPPCC__CCRREEAATT   to create a new segment.  If this flag is not used, then sshhmmggeett() will find the segment associated with _k_e_y and check to see if the user has permission to access the segment.

       IIPPCC__EEXXCCLL    used with IIPPCC__CCRREEAATT to ensure failure if the segment already exists.

       _m_o_d_e___f_l_a_g_s  (least significant 9 bits) specifying the permissions granted to the owner, group, and world.  These bits have the same format, and the same meaning, as the _m_o_d_e argument of ooppeenn(2).  Presently, the execute permissions
                   are not used by the system.

       SSHHMM__HHUUGGEETTLLBB (since Linux 2.6)
                   Allocate the segment using "huge pages."  See the Linux kernel source file _D_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n_/_v_m_/_h_u_g_e_t_l_b_p_a_g_e_._t_x_t for further information.

       SSHHMM__NNOORREESSEERRVVEE (since Linux 2.6.15)
                   This  flag  serves  the  same purpose as the mmmmaapp(2) MMAAPP__NNOORREESSEERRVVEE flag.  Do not reserve swap space for this segment.  When swap space is reserved, one has the guarantee that it is possible to modify the segment.  When
                   swap space is not reserved one might get SSIIGGSSEEGGVV upon a write if no physical memory is available.  See also the discussion of the file _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_v_m_/_o_v_e_r_c_o_m_m_i_t___m_e_m_o_r_y in pprroocc(5).

       When a new shared memory segment is created, its contents are initialized to zero values, and its associated data structure, _s_h_m_i_d___d_s (see sshhmmccttll(2)), is initialized as follows:

              _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._c_u_i_d and _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._u_i_d are set to the effective user ID of the calling process.

              _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._c_g_i_d and _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._g_i_d are set to the effective group ID of the calling process.

              The least significant 9 bits of _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._m_o_d_e are set to the least significant 9 bit of _s_h_m_f_l_g.

              _s_h_m___s_e_g_s_z is set to the value of _s_i_z_e.

              _s_h_m___l_p_i_d, _s_h_m___n_a_t_t_c_h, _s_h_m___a_t_i_m_e and _s_h_m___d_t_i_m_e are set to 0.

              _s_h_m___c_t_i_m_e is set to the current time.

       If the shared memory segment already exists, the permissions are verified, and a check is made to see if it is marked for destruction.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       On success, a valid shared memory identifier is returned.  On errir, -1 is returned, and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

EERRRROORRSS
       On failure, _e_r_r_n_o is set to one of the following:

       EEAACCCCEESS The user does not have permission to access the shared memory segment, and does not have the CCAAPP__IIPPCC__OOWWNNEERR capability.

       EEEEXXIISSTT IIPPCC__CCRREEAATT || IIPPCC__EEXXCCLL was specified and the segment exists.

       EEIINNVVAALL A new segment was to be created and _s_i_z_e < SSHHMMMMIINN or _s_i_z_e > SSHHMMMMAAXX, or no new segment was to be created, a segment with given key existed, but _s_i_z_e is greater than the size of that segment.

       EENNFFIILLEE The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       EENNOOEENNTT No segment exists for the given _k_e_y, and IIPPCC__CCRREEAATT was not specified.

       EENNOOMMEEMM No memory could be allocated for segment overhead.

       EENNOOSSPPCC All possible shared memory IDs have been taken (SSHHMMMMNNII), or allocating a segment of the requested _s_i_z_e would cause the system to exceed the system-wide limit on shared memory (SSHHMMAALLLL).

       EEPPEERRMM  The SSHHMM__HHUUGGEETTLLBB flag was specified, but the caller was not privileged (did not have the CCAAPP__IIPPCC__LLOOCCKK capability).

       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

       SSHHMM__HHUUGGEETTLLBB is a nonportable Linux extension.

NNOOTTEESS
       The inclusion of _<_s_y_s_/_t_y_p_e_s_._h_> and _<_s_y_s_/_i_p_c_._h_> isn't required on Linux or by any version of POSIX.  However, some old implementations required the inclusion of these header files, and the  SVID  also  documented  their  inclusion.
       Applications intended to be portable to such old systems may need to include these header files.

       IIPPCC__PPRRIIVVAATTEE isn't a flag field but a _k_e_y___t type.  If this special value is used for _k_e_y, the system call ignores everything but the least significant 9 bits of _s_h_m_f_l_g and creates a new shared memory segment (on success).

       The following limits on shared memory segment resources affect the sshhmmggeett() call:

       SSHHMMAALLLL System wide maximum of shared memory pages (on Linux, this limit can be read and modified via _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_k_e_r_n_e_l_/_s_h_m_a_l_l).

       SSHHMMMMAAXX Maximum size in bytes for a shared memory segment: policy dependent (on Linux, this limit can be read and modified via _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_k_e_r_n_e_l_/_s_h_m_m_a_x).

       SSHHMMMMIINN Minimum size in bytes for a shared memory segment: implementation dependent (currently 1 byte, though PPAAGGEE__SSIIZZEE is the effective minimum size).

       SSHHMMMMNNII System wide maximum number of shared memory segments: implementation dependent (currently 4096, was 128 before Linux 2.3.99; on Linux, this limit can be read and modified via _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_k_e_r_n_e_l_/_s_h_m_m_n_i).

       The implementation has no specific limits for the per-process maximum number of shared memory segments (SSHHMMSSEEGG).

   LLiinnuuxx nnootteess
       Until version 2.3.30 Linux would return EEIIDDRRMM for a sshhmmggeett() on a shared memory segment scheduled for deletion.

       The name choice IIPPCC__PPRRIIVVAATTEE was perhaps unfortunate, IIPPCC__NNEEWW would more clearly show its function.
